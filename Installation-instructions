Style changes to webtrees 2.0 for all themes

There are two ways to use these style changes for webtrees.

Option 1 - If you only want these changes to apply to one theme then copy the "contents" of the 
	   common.css to the end of the specific style sheet, located in /public/css.

Option 2 - Use the styles in common.css in all standard webtrees themes - Note only will work for 2.0 github update as of 12 March 2019.
 
           There are several steps necessary in order to use a common.css file in the 2.0 version of webtrees.
           Step 1 - copy this style sheet into folder /public/css
           Step 2 - Go to Control panel / All Modules and enable module CSS and JSS and then do a save
	   Step 3 - Go to Control panel / All Modules and select the wrench [Preferences] for CSS and JSS
	   Step 4 - Add this value in the <head> element   <link rel="stylesheet" href="public/css/common.css">

The FamilyBookChartModule.php, located in app/Module, has been modified to improve vertical line handling.  However,
it can only be used along with the common.css changes.
