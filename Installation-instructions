Style changes to webtrees 2.0 for all themes

There are two ways to use these style changes for webtrees.

Option 1 - If you only want these changes to apply to one theme then copy the contents of the 
common.css to the end of the specific style sheet, located in /public/css.

Option 2 - Use the styles in colors.css in all standard webtrees themes.
 
           There are several steps necessary in order to use a common.css file in the 2.0 version of webtrees.
           Step 1 - this style sheet into folder /public/css
           Step 2 - add a <link to the stylesheet to file default.phtml located in folder /resources/views/layouts
  
           <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?= e(asset('css/common.css')) ?>">
  
            This link must reside after the standard stylesheets and will look like this:
  
           <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?= e(asset('css/vendor.min.css')) ?>">
           <?php foreach (app(ModuleThemeInterface::class)->stylesheets() as $stylesheet) : ?>
               <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?=  e($stylesheet) ?>">
               <?php endforeach ?>
		   <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?= e(asset('css/common.css')) ?>">
           <?= View::stack('styles') ?>

The FamilyBookChartModule.php, located in app/Module, has been modified to improve vertical line handling.  However,
it can only be used along with the common.css changes.
